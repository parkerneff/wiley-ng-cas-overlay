# Custom Authentication Handler
A very basic custom authentication handler has been created to demostrate a custom authentication handler that could be created to to call the NG User API for 
actual authentication

The authentication handler was built using the instructions here: https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.2.x/installation/Configuring-Custom-Authentication.html

The custom authentication handler class created is com.wileyng.cas.auth.NgAuthenticationHandler
The registration configuation class is com.wileyng.cas.auth.NgAuthenticationEventExecutionPlanConfiguration
The configuration for the handler is in src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories
